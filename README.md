# GPU-Accelerated-Funnel-Hashing
CUDA-based implementation of Funnel Hashing, a multi-level open addressing scheme optimized for parallel insertions. Utilizes shared memory, atomic operations, and thread-level concurrency for high-throughput GPU performance.

To run this CUDA code, ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and the CUDA Toolkit installed. Compile the .cu file using nvcc, the NVIDIA compiler, and then execute the output binary. On university systems like GAIVI, load the appropriate CUDA module first using module load cuda.
